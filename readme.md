> Calculate the [Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance) between two points

![Chebyshev distance from the square F6](diagram.png)

This module exposes the function `chebyshev(a, b)`, which determines the Chebyshev distance between points `a` and `b`.
```js
> const distance = require('chebyshev')
> distance([6, 6], [5, 2])
4
```
